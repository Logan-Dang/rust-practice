# Rust Practice
This repo is meant for my friend group so that they don't have to feel alone in learning Rust-lang.

### How to Get Started with Rust
- Download and install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- Follow along with Rust's [tutorial for a number guessing game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
- Start your own game and use Google as you go.

### How to Contribute
- Tag me on discord so I can add you as a contributor.
- Open an issue with the title of the small game you're making (Hangman, Wordle, etc.)
- Make sure your game hasn't been claimed by someone else.
- Open a pull request once you are done with your game/small project.
